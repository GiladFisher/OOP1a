### Introduction
The Observable object, GroupAdmin, is an implementation of the Sender interface that was provided by course staff and containes an instance of "UndoableStringBuilder", a class that we wrote in the previous task to add the "Undo" feature to the already existing "StringBuilder" class found in java. The object also keeps track of the registered "Member" objects, which it will later inform of any update to the "UndoableStringBuilder".
